# DecentraChat

DecentraChat is a decentralized, AI-powered chat platform designed to enable secure, scalable, and transparent communication. This repository serves as the planning and development layout for the capstone project, including the roadmap, architecture design, task management, and documentation prior to full implementation.

The project demonstrates how decentralization and AI integration can work together to create a modern messaging system that prioritizes user privacy, intelligent conversation, and system resilience. (This project is meant to be a development design for senior capstone project though this is not the full project).

# Project Status

ðŸš§ In Planning Phase ðŸš§
Currently, DecentraChat focuses on design, research, and documentation. The core development phase will begin once the system architecture and AI integration strategy are finalized. This stage includes:

Researching decentralized messaging protocols.

Defining AI features and integration methods.

Designing system architecture and encryption strategy.

Preparing documentation and roadmap for the capstone review.

# Objectives

Decentralized Communication: Eliminate single points of failure through a peer-to-peer or federated architecture.

AI-Powered Messaging: Implement intelligent, context-aware interactions such as message summarization, auto-replies, or language translation.

End-to-End Encryption: Ensure all messages are private, secure, and tamper-proof.

Modular and Scalable Design: Build a system that can easily incorporate new features, AI modules, or network protocols.

Capstone Prototype: Provide a functional prototype demonstrating the feasibility of decentralized AI messaging.

Uniqueness & Innovation

DecentraChat stands out from existing decentralized messaging platforms (like Matrix, Briar, Status, or Session) because it combines:

Decentralization + AI Integration: Unlike most apps that focus only on privacy or decentralization, DecentraChat integrates AI to enhance user experience.

Research-Driven Prototype: Designed for academic evaluation rather than just production deployment.

Modularity for Future Development: Supports extensibility for additional features such as blockchain verification, AI-powered moderation, or multi-platform support.

This combination positions DecentraChat as a forward-thinking project in the space of secure and intelligent messaging systems.
