# DecentraChat

DecentraChat is a decentralized, AI-powered chat platform designed to enable secure, scalable, and transparent communication. This repository serves as the planning and development layout for the capstone project, including the roadmap, architecture design, task management, and documentation before the full implementation phase.

# Project Status

ðŸš§ In Planning Phase ðŸš§
This project is currently focused on design and documentation. Core development will begin once the system architecture and AI integration strategy are finalized.

# Objectives

Decentralized Communication: Design a system that eliminates single points of failure.

AI Integration: Implement intelligent, context-aware chat interactions.

Secure Messaging: Provide end-to-end encryption for all communications.

Modular Design: Develop a scalable, extensible architecture for future features.

Prototype Development: Prepare a functional prototype as part of the capstone project.

# Roadmap

Draft system architecture and select technology stack

Research decentralized messaging protocols

Plan AI integration strategy (NLP models)

Document encryption and security design

Develop MVP prototype

Test decentralized chat flow with AI integration

Finalize capstone report and documentation
